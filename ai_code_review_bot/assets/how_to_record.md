# How to Record a Code Review Demo

1. **Prepare a pull request:** Create a test pull request on your repository with a few file changes.
2. **Run the workflow:** Ensure the `code_review.yml` workflow has run and posted the AI review comment.
3. **Record your screen:** Use a tool like Loom, Screenity, or built‑in OS recording to capture the GitHub interface showing the PR and the bot’s comment.
4. **Highlight the AI feedback:** Scroll through the comment to show summary and improvement suggestions.
5. **Export as GIF or MP4:** Save your recording in the `assets/` folder (e.g. `code_review_demo.gif`) and update your README to link to it.

A 15–30 second clip is enough to convey the value of automated code reviews to potential employers or teammates.
